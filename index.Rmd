# What is Sentinel-2 ?
- **Sentinel-2** is a **wide-swath, high-resolution, multi-spectral imaging mission** launched by **Copernicus Programme**. 

- Its  optical instrument samples in 13 spectral bands: four bands at 10 metres, six bands at 20 metres and three bands at 60 metres spatial resolution.

# What is Sentinel-2 ?
- The Sentinel-2 constellation made of twin satellites. 

- The mission is based on a constellation of **two identical satellites(Sentinel-2A and Sentinel-2B**) in the same orbit, 180° apart for optimal coverage and data delivery.

- Sentinel-2A was launched on 23 June 2015 and Sentinel-2B was launched on 7 March 2017. 

- Each satellite has **a swath width of 290 km** to provide systematic **coverage over the following areas**:
1. all continental land surfaces between latitudes 84°N and 56°S;
1. all coastal waters up to at least 20 km from the shore;
1. all islands greater than 100 km2;
1. all EU islands;
1. the Mediterranean Sea;
1. all closed seas

# Sentinel-2 data
- Available in different processed forms(Drusch et al.,2012).

- The main stages include Level-0, Level-1A, Level-1B, Level-1C and Level 2A.

# Applications
### Pixel-Based Image Analysis 
- One of the most **common classification approaches** applied to Sentinel-2.

- **RF** is the most common classifiers used for pixel-based approach.

- Due to the **limitations of pixel-based approaches, such as salt-and-pepper effect or speckle—spectral noise**, **sub-pixel methods** have been applied on Sentinel-2 data to improve the classification accuracy(Clark,2017). 

- **To reduce mixed pixel effects**,Spectral mixture analysis (SMA) is one of the robust methods. For example, Degerickx, et al. applied Multiple Endmember Spectral Mixture Analysis (MESMA) to urban land cover/use and achieved an accuracy of 85%.

# Applications
### Object-Based Image Analysis
- OBIA produces higher classification accuracy compared to pixel-based(Gašparović & Jogun,2018).
- Many studies have focused on the application of **the combination of OBIA with machine-learning classifiers** on land cover/use classification (Novelli et al.,2016).

### Opportunities
- The revelation between OBIA and advanced ML classifiers marks a transformative shift in data processing techniques. 

- Promise incremental improvements in **land cover and use classification**.

- Herald a paradigm shift in how we approach **environmental monitoring and land management**.

### Challenges
- **Cloud coverage** obscures the full potential of optical satellite imagery. 

- The need of **expansion of is application in untested regions**.

- Its adoption is **in its early stages**, especially when juxtaposed with the legacy of the Landsat program.

# Reflections
Looking ahead, the emergence of Sentinel-2 data opens up new vistas for a diverse array of stakeholders, including the private sector, government agencies, academia, and environmental practitioners.

- This expansion is not just about scaling the heights of technological innovation; it's about **democratizing access to high-quality, timely, and actionable environmental data**. 

- The imperative to integrate Sentinel-2 data into **regional, national, and global environmental** strategies is clear. 

- The journey ahead is fraught with challenges, yet it's imbued with the promise of harnessing our planet's spectral signatures to **foster a more sustainable and resilient world**.
